# GisFIRE-SpreadSimulation
GisFire modude to simulate wildfire spread. It is mainly a FARSITE implementation.

# GisFIRE

GisFIRE SpreadSimulation is a plugin for QGIS that implements a wildfire spread
simulator and other tools related to wildfire management. It is part of a PhD
and implements a [FARSITE](https://www.firelab.org/project/farsite)
[software](https://github.com/firelab/farsite) port to python integrated into
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/). It is also an intent to be a framework to
develop and test other spread simulation algorithms different from the ones
implemented in FARSITE or other management tools.
